A Visual Studio build monitor for Windows 8. Still a very rough work in progress with more to come.

At the moment it will only work in Visual Studio 2012 (and I hope obviously) only with Windows 8.

The intention is ultimately to have a metro (sorry, Windows RT 'Modern UI') app for personal, project-by-project build history and analytics.

Here be dragons (more bugs really). Please use at your own discretion..
